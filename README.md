# Customer Transaction Prediction
This repository contains my personal project for the Santander Customer Transaction Prediction competition on Kaggle. The goal of this project is to build machine learning models that can accurately predict which customers will make a specific transaction in the future.

**Project Overview**

At Santander, the mission is to help people and businesses prosper. One of the critical tasks is to understand customer behavior and predict future transactions. This project aims to tackle the challenge of binary classification problems, such as predicting customer satisfaction, product purchases, and loan repayments.

**Challenge Description**

The challenge is to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the transaction amount. The provided dataset has the same structure as the real data used by Santander to solve this problem.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes various features that can be used to build predictive models. The data is structured to reflect real-world scenarios and is provided by Santander for the competition. (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/data)

**Objective**

The primary objective is to develop machine learning models that can predict future transactions accurately. This involves exploring the dataset, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
